## Hex

This is the game of hex. It's built using javascript, html, and css. You and an opponent take turns choosing squares. P1 (red) is trying to build an uninterrupted line from top to bottom. P2 (blue) is trying to build an uninterrupted line from left to right.

On the closing stretch, I got a little careless. The CSS and HTML is not as pretty as it could be, and i duct taped together some parts that probably should have been done in such a jenky way.
