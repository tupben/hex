This is the game of hex. It's built using javascript, html, and css. You and an opponent take turns choosing squares. P1 (red) is trying to build an uninterrupted line from top to bottom. P2 (blue) is trying to build an uninterrupted line from left to right.


Still needs / could use:

- indication of player turn
- indication of player direction (up, down, left, right)
- announcement of winner (now, only in the counsole)
- glowing pieces that follow the winning route
